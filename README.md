Learned SO much on this one!! This was an opportunity to put my new vanilla JS skills together for a final project. 
I ended up using webpack's HTMLWebpackPlugin to render the HTML content for me.
Ignore the design it's not really my forte! (Although I had a lot of fun with attempting some glassmorphism ðŸ™ƒ)
Thanks to [bscottnz](https://github.com/bscottnz/todo) for svg and layout inspo!

### I learned: 

1. how to implement classes, store data in objects and retrieve that data
(yes I chose to use classes not factory functions just to learn more about how they work!)
2. How to implement and organize code in JS Modules - I still think my code could be even more modular
3. How to use SVG spriting to store SVGs in one file
4. Using local storage to store data!
5. SO much more about rendering HTML dynamically in JS
